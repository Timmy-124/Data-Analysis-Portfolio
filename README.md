 ## Employee Attrition Analysis
   ### Case Study: Employee Attrition Analysis for "Sweet Life" Healthcare Company
   ### Overview
   “Sweet Life”, a fictional healthcare company, has high employee attrition which has become a significant concern for the company. The cost of recruiting, training, and integrating new employees is substantial. Furthermore, high turnover disrupts team dynamics and knowledge continuity, leading to potential delays in project delivery and a decline in service quality. This analysis aims to uncover the underlying causes of employee attrition, and provide actionable insights to develop targeted retention strategies.
### Objectives
   The primary objectives of this analysis are; 
   1. Identifying key drivers of attrition
   2. Performing a segment analysis to determine which employee group are most affected
   3. Providing actionable recommendations to reduce employee attrition and improve employee retention
### Stakeholder
   Human Resources (HR) Department: The HR team is the primary stakeholder responsible for employee recruitment, retention, and engagement. They are particularly interested in understanding the drivers of attrition and implementing strategies to retain talent 
### Tools Used
- Structured Query Language (SQL): SQL was utilized for cleaning and analyzing the data [View Here](https://github.com/Timmy-124/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Employee%20Attrition%20Analysis)
- Tableau: Tableau was utilized to create an interactive dashboard to present findings [View Here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/timilehin.egbeyemi/viz/EmployeeAttritionDashboard_17201754430620/EmployeeAttritionDashb_)
 ### Analysis and Findings
 ### Overall Attrition & Segment Analysis
  1. The total attrition rate was calculated as 16.12% indicating the percentage of employees who left with an attrition count of 237 employees.
  2. The highest turn over was observed in the Research and Development Department, with rate of 56.12%
  3. Male employees have higher attrition rate than the female employees with 63.29%
  4. Laboratory and technician job role had the highest attrition rate with 26.16%
  5. Employees within a 1 year of tenure had the highest attrition rate at 24.89%, indicating early exits
  ### Key Drivers of Attrition
  1. Age and Tenure: Younger employees (aged 26-35) with 1-2 years of tenure were more likely to leave the company. This group accounted for 48.95% of the total attrition
  2. Salary: Employees who earns less than $3,000 monthly were most likely to leave the company
  3. Job Satisfaction: Employees who rated their job satisfaction as below average had the higher chance of leaving the company
  4. Work-Life Balance: Employees who rated their work-life balance as poor had the highest attrition
  5. Overtime: Employees who mostly have overtime schedules had the highest attrition rate at 58%
 ### Recommendations
  1. Enhance Salary Packages: Enhancing the benefits package and salaries to make them competitive within the industry can prevent employees from leaving for better offers 
     elsewhere and can prevent attrition
  2. Career Development: Implementing structured career development programs can encourage employees to grow and learn more within the company, especially for employees in high turnover 
     roles
  3. Improving Work-Life Balance: Due to the high attrition rate of employees who rated their work life balance as poor, it is recommended that the company introduce flexible working 
     hours, remote work options and wellness programs that help in improving the work life balance of employees
  4. Workload Management: Implementing effective workload management can be very effective in reducing overtime hours by ensuring deadlines are achievable during working hours
  5. Strenghten Employee Engagement: Employees who work as laboratory and technicians should be given a huge amount of attention due to a very high attrition rate, by conducting regular 
     employee satisfaction surveys and take proactive measures based on feedback to improve employee satisfactions and reduce employee attrition. Fostering a positive workplace culture 
     by recognizing employee contribution, promoting teamwork, and providing opportunities for social interaction can improve employee retention.
  6. Monitoring KPIs: KPIs used in monitoring attrition rates by department, tenure and job role should be reviewed quarterly to assess the effectiveness of retention strategies.
